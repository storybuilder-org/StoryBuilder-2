The sudden dissolution of Nora's marriage was, to 19th century audiences, even more of a shock than to modern audiences.\par&#xD;&#xA;      Notes on this outline:\par&#xD;&#xA;      The \f1 Scene\f0  outline \f1 is based on\f0  'French scenes.'  A scene change is indicated every time a character enters or leaves the stage.\par&#xD;&#xA;      A number of times in this play,  Ibsen uses a technique which is the stage equivalent of the Sequel. A scene's protagonist (usually Nora) remains onstage after the scene's other characters exit, and delivers a brief monolog, reacting to the events in the scene.  In this \f1 scene\f0  outline the Sequel tab is often used to describe these transitionary moments.\par&#xD;&#xA;    The physical appearance of the characters is left vague, as is normal with plays, to allow the \f1 play-runner \f0 freedom in casting the roles. \par&#xD;&#xA;\par&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;\pard\fs23\par&#xD;&#xA;}&#xD;&#xA;" />
