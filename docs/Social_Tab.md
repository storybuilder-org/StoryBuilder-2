### Social Tab ###
Social Tab <br/>

![](Character-Social-Tab.png)

These elements are the major factors which affect this character's behavior and which come from the influence of others or the community. <br/>

The four socializing factors on this tab are important, but there is another, equally important source of social influence: specific relationships with other people.  Parents are notable examples. <br/>

Social factors may act as a source of story conflict, either externally with another character or characters, or internally within the character, war with each other in character, when contradicted by events or learning. , as a source of story conflict.  For example, a young white boy might have been raised to dislike or distrust blacks,  but the positive influence of a particular person of color  could conflict with that background.  This type of conflict is common in 'Man against Society' stories. <br/>

Fields: <br/>

Economic Status <br/>

Use this field to hold information about the economic/financial status of the character. <br/>

In considering this trait, consider wealth as a form of freedom; the poor are often shorn of choices which the wealthy enjoy. <br/>

However, wealth can also serve as an insulator, which isolates a character from real life. This is true more of inherited than earned money, so also consider how any wealth was acquired. <br/>

Changes in economic status can be powerful sources of conflict. <br/>

Education <br/>

Use this field to hold information about the character's education. <br/>

Education is a primary means of social mobility, or rising above poverty or humble beginnings.  But education is also sometimes associated with class separation, snobbish behavior, and lack of worldliness. <br/>

In either roll, positive or negative, education can place a character in conflict with his previous (before school) environment. <br/>

Ethnic and Cultural <br/>

Use this field to hold information  about the ethnic and cultural background of the character.  These factors can provide great color and variety to stories. <br/>

Be sure that you know the ethnic group or culture you're writing about, either from experience or from careful research--- or both.   <br/>
 If you don’t know the group you’re writing about, get to know multiple members of that group.  <br/>

Be wary of stereotyping.  In fact, interesting characters often come from providing character traits which are at deliberate odds to stereotypes. <br/>

As with other social factors, changes in the ethnic and cultural environment can provide a source of story conflicts.  This happens in situations in which a person moves from one social group or strata to another,  such as from employment, travel, or marriage. <br/>

Religion <br/>

Use this field on the Social Background tab of the Character form to hold information about the religious background and status of the character. <br/>

Religion is not widely used in fictional character development except in religious market genres.  Characters frequently express religious beliefs, but don't show or act upon them except in unusual circumstances. <br/>

But religion can provide a foundation for characters in crisis, a source of comfort and strength when things are at their darkest. Consider It’s a Wonderful Life. A religious background can provide the basis for character choices at the turning point.  This is especially true for stories in which the protagonist is on the brink of a fall into immoral or unethical behavior.  <br/>
