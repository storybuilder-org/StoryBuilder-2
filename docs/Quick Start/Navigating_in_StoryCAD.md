# Navigating in StoryCAD

Your outline is a tree of story elements, which are displayed in the Navigation Pane. Here's how to move around in this visual tree, and within a story element, and how to edit properties on a story element.

You can add and remove story elements either using the menu bar's Add button or via a fly-out panel from the Navigation Pane, as described below.

A story element's Content Pane displays the properties of that story element. We organized the related properties into tabs as described below.
