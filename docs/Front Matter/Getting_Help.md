Getting Help

We suggest you first use this manual to try to find the information you’re looking for.

[The StoryBuilder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/g7jjtgBKsQ) contains a ‘frequently-asked-questions’ channel, and a ‘writers-chat’ channel.

Currently StoryCAD’s only direct support mechanism is to email support@storybuilder.org.

We plan to provide an on-line help request form as soon as possible.

Please write us with ideas or suggestions for improvements.  We want to make StoryCAD the best possible tool to help you achieve your fiction writing goals.
