# Contributing

Hello, and welcome! Thank you for wanting to help improve StoryBuilder. Here's what you need to know.

If you have a question, make sure it wasn't [already asked or answered][1]. If not, you may 
want to open an issue or discussion on GitHub. Issues come in two flavors, bug reports
and feature requests. All changes to StoryBuilder must start with an issue.

### Bugs

'Programs are the footprints of bugs' - Anonymous

If you're a writer/user, remember that nobody knows a program like the person who uses it
the most- not even the guys who wrote it. If StoryBuilder is of use to you, it's in your
interest for it work properly. If you find a bug in your use of the program, please 
report it by opening an issue. 

If you're developing and you find a bug not related to your current contribution, please
report it as well. If you want to self-assign and start working on a fix, 
we'll be forever grateful. 

Bug reports are tricky. Please provide as much context as possible. If possible, provide a 
demo where the bug is isolated and turned into its smallest possible representation. That 
would help a lot!

Thanks for reporting bugs, we'd be lost without you.

### Feature Requests

We're always looking for feature requests. We'll try to prioriize new feature development 
that makes our users happy. Toward that end, we'll put together a feature voting system 
in the near future. The goal is making StoryBuilder more usable.

### Following up

If you open an issue and it's either implemented or under development, please 
stay involved. Comments on the issue are always welcome and appreciated. Once
the implementation is rolled out, check that what was delivered adresses your 
issue.
