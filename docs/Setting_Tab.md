### Setting Tab ###
Setting Tab <br/>


The Setting tab contains elements which make the setting specific and unique. <br/>

  <br/>

Locale	The location of the setting in space. <br/>

Season	These locate the setting in time. <br/>
Period <br/>

Lighting	These help to define the setting as a source of mood and atmosphere <br/>
Weather <br/>
Temperature	 <br/>

Props	These elements make the scene specific for the characters, and therefore for the reader. An ashtray that a character nervously rocks back and forth is a prop. Props give characters little things to do (‘business’, in stage  <br/>

If a setting is used in multiple scenes, but the significance of the setting changes, with a different atmosphere or props, you may want to create a separate outline entry for the new setting. <br/>
