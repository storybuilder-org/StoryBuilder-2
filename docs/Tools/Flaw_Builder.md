Flaw Builder

![](../media/Flaw-Builder.png)

This tool is invoked from a button on the Character Form’s Flaw tab. It explores some common examples of character flaws to help you in developing a character.

Generally, a character flaw should become a problem of its own, a ‘person against himself’ or internal problem. The Problem Type is usually discovery; self-awareness is the start of the solution. The failure to overcome a flaw is tragic: Hamlet’s indecision is an example.
