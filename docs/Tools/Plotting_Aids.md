## Plotting Aids

Plotting Aids

The Plotting Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu displays a pull-down sub-menu of tools specific to the process of defining your plot.

The Master Plots tool will populate your plot outline with a set of plot points according to a template or master plot outline, or will provide information on commonly recurring plot patterns.

The Dramatic Situations tool uses standard dramatic situations to help you beef up the drama in an existing scene, or to add a scene which relies on a particular dramatic situation.

The Stock Scenes tool provides lists of scenes frequently found in certain plotting situations, or in a particular genre.
