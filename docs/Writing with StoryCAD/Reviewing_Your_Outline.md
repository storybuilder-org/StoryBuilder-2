## Reviewing Your Outline
Reviewing Your Outline

Key Questions, from the Tools menu, provides a checklist for each of the major story element types. Stepping through these questions can help you to refine your outline.

We recommend using Key Questions frequently, as you work, rather than waiting until the outlineâ€™s complete before you review it.
