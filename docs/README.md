It's CAD for fiction writers. The elements StoryBuilder works with are the elements of good fiction: realistic three dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.StoryBuilder is currently in beta test. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, please email tcox@svsoft.com and ask for a copy of the software. Our goal is to distributethe software through [Microsoft Store][6].## ContributionStoryBuilder is an odd duck, with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writersand the community of developers. And, perhaps, in the Venn diagram of these two communities,there are a few writer-develpers....If you would like to join the StoryBuilder community and help make the software better,here are some [ways to make StoryBuilder better][5].### For writersIf you're strictly in the writer camp, welcome! You may want to mosey over to [User Documentation][2]. Better yet, try the software for yourself.### For developersIf you're developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn more about StoryBuilder,so you should read the [User Documentation][2] and use the program a bit before you try to use it. Once you've read through this document are familiar with the program, take a look at [Programmer Notes][3].## Copyright & LicenseStoryBuilder was initially developed by Terry Cox for Seven Valleys Software andis @Copyright Sevens Valley Software.Except where otherwise noted, StoryBuilder is released under the [GNU GPLv3][1] license.See the LICENSE file located in this directory.GPLv3 was selected for the same reason car dealerships don't leave the keys in the cars while they're on the lot and before they're sold. The intent is to move to an MIT License in the near future, once this site is up and running.## AcknowledgementsStoryBuilder is a free and open source too for fiction writers, and the goal is to have both writers and developers collaborate to ensure that it' worth using. We hope to see new contibutors join the effort to make StoryBuilder even better.StoryBuilder was initially developed by Terry Cox for Seven Valleys Software andis @Copyright Sevens Valley Software.Except where otherwise noted, StiryBuilder is released under the [GNU GPLv3][1] license.See the LICENSE file located in this directory.GPLv3 was selected for the same reason car dealerships don't leave the keys in the cars while they're on the lot and before they're sold. The intent is to move to an MIT License in the near future, once this site is up and running.[1]:https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/[2]:https://github.com/terrycox/StoryBuilder-2/blob/master/docs/USERNOTES.md[3]:https://github.com/terrycox/StoryBuilder-2/blob/master/docs/DEVNOTES.md[4]:https://github.com/terrycox/StoryBuilder-2/blob/master/docs/ACKNOWLEDGE.md[5]:https://github.com/terrycox/StoryBuilder-2/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTE.md[6]:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows
