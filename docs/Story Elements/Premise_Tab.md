Story Problem

Your story can (and usually will) have more than one Problem. Every Problem has a Premise, but only one of your Problem story elements is the Story Problem. It’s the spine of your story; when it’s resolved, your story is over. Select one of your  Problem pages from the drop-down list as the ‘Story Problem’ (here, ‘Hamlet wants to avenge his father’s murder’.)

Premise

The Premise field on the Story Overview form is a read-only copy of the Premise field on the selected Story Problem’s Resolution tab.  Every Problem can contain a Premise, and you would do well to create one for each problem.
