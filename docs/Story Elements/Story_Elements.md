# Story Elements

Your outline is a tree of Story Element nodes. Although there are story element node types for organizing the tree (Folder and Section) and for research (Notes and Webpage), they're described elsewhere in the manual. This section describer the five key story element types that are fundamental components that make up your story.

We compose a story element from smaller fields that we call story properties. The content pane organizes related story properties as tabs for a story element.
