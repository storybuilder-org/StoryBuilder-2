A character flaw is a negative trait that affects your character or others in a bad way. Flaws vary in severity; some are just unpleasant quirks, but a major flaw will have story consequences. It’s almost always at the root of a character arc, and must be corrected (a redemption arc) or will lead to your character’s downfall  (a fatal flaw.)

The Flaw Builder tool can help you find a flaw suitable to your character.
