### Concept Tab


![](../media/Overview-Concept-Tab.png)

A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict.  The answer to that question is your story.  

Concept is what begins to shape your idea into a story. Taking the time to create a compelling concept is key to a good story. 

Initially, phrase your concept as a "what if" question. Then use ‘What if? And ‘What happens is’ to flesh out your idea. 

A good concept sparks more “what if” questions.

Other Examples:

The da Vinci Code

	•	What if Leonardo da Vinci hid clues about Christianity’s origins in his painting of “The Last Supper?”

	•	What if Christianity’s true beginnings are a secret protected by a secret organization?

	•	What if Mary bore Christ’s child?


The Godfather

	•	What if a man justifies becoming a criminal out of family loyalty?


When Harry Met Sally

	•	Can men and women be friends? 

	•	Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?
