## Reviewing Your Outline ##
Reviewing Your Outline <br/>

Key Questions, from the Tools menu, provides a checklist for each of the major story element types. Stepping through these questions can help you to refine your outline. <br/>

We recommend using Key Questions frequently, as you work, rather than waiting until the outlineâ€™s complete before you review it. <br/>
