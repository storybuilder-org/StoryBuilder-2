### Tabs ###
Tabs		 <br/>

For most Story Element types, that Form contains multiple tabs. Clicking or touching a Tab name (the larger font) will switch to that tabâ€™s content.  <br/>

Tabs allow you to easily switch between different sections of a form, rather than having to navigate through multiple separate pages or windows. A tab organizes and groups related information. <br/>

In some cases (and particularly if you resize the StoryCAD window smaller) not all tabs will show. In that case  the tabs will form a carousel you can scroll left or right by using the left or right arrows that appear at the edges of the tab area. <br/>
