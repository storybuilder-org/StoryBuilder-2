### Navigation and  Content Panes ###
Navigation and Content Panes <br/>

The Navigation Pane allows you to view, organize, and manage the parts of your story outline in a hierarchical structure.  It’s similar to the Windows File Explorer, but instead of files and folders, each node in the tree is a Story Elements  Your outline is composed of five Story Element types: <br/>

	•	Story Overview  <br/>
	•	Problem <br/>
	•	Character <br/>
	•	Setting <br/>
	•	Scene <br/>

There are also two  Story Element types to assist in organizing your outline: <br/>

	•	Folder <br/>
	•	Section <br/>

Two more assist in researching your story: <br/>

	•	Web <br/>
	•	Notes <br/>

There’s also a Trashcan node which is the parent for other nodes you wish to discard. <br/>

Clicking (or touching) a Story Element node on the Navigation Pane will display that Story Element’s  content in the Content Panel. Each Story Element type has its own form; the major ones are tabbed. <br/>

On some screen sizes and orientations the Navigation and Content panes may be stacked with the Navigation pane above the Content pane. In those cases the Show/Hide Navigation button (the hamburger menu button) acts differently; it toggles from the Navigation Pane to the Content Pane and back. <br/>

Your outline has only one Story Overview; it’s created automatically when you open or create a new outline. The Story Overview is the root of the Navigation Pane tree, and all other Story Elements are below it.  <br/>

Every major form also has a full-page tab (labeled Notes) which holds your general notes and thoughts regarding the story element. We won’t talk about these again; just be aware that they’re there. <br/>
