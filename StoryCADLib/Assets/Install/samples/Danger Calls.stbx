There\u0027s also Kik and Confide. They might use one of those.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nLacas, as a second-tier dealer, distributes only to a handful of people, \u0027runners\u0027, street peddlers who sell in clubs and to a select group of customers. They\u0027re called runners because they usually go to their customers, or at least arrange locations for sales.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nhttps://www.wireless-technology-advisor.com/how-do-pagers-work.html\\par\r\nhttps://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/12/10-technologies-drug-dealers-need-to-stay-out-of-jail/\\par\r\n\\par\r\nWhat drugs you sell is apparently a major part in how likely you are to get caught. Marijuana is so legally available and common that selling it, while still common, is often below the radar. It\u0027s sold cheaply and is a sort of introductory product. Meth and such are much higher profile and dangerous to deal. Heroin is slightly less risky, but so highly addictive and destructive to its users\u0027 health and lifestyle that it\u0027s often problematic. It\u0027s a depressant and large doses often result in respiratory depression. Lacas would press his runners to limit and moderate their customers\u0027 use. Cocaine is a drug of choice,  profitable and with regular users, but the materials used to cut it often cause health problems. It\u0027s a stimulant and excessive doses often cause cardiotoxicity. Lacas would rigidly control the cutting of his cocaine. There\u0027s also over-the-counter drugs such as fentanyl. These are not as widely prosecuted, but frequently they\u0027re got through prescription abuse. With no access to this market, Lacas avoids it. When found on the street, it\u0027s usually resold by prescription users, or occasionally through pharmacy theft, which attracts a lot of attention. In short, Lacas would manage his product and distribution channels carefully.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nCharlie\u0027s runners need phones to be reached by their customers, and they use disposable phones bought with cash at Walmart and periodically replaced. Lacas insists on newer smartphone disposables, which cost a bit more ($50-50) but can run apps like Signal. He insists that his runners\u0027 customers use Signal to order. But Lacas himself could use a different approach, since he\u0027s talking to only to his runners.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nPhones, even prepaid disposable \u0027burner\u0027 phones, are a risk. Disposable phones might be harder to trace to you as an individual (unless you\u0027re caught with it in your possession), but are traceable with geolocation.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nPagers are old-school, but they have some advantages. The simplicity of the pager makes it nearly impossible to accidentally transmit sensitive data, so all that gets sent is some codewords. Pagers can provide tone or voice messages, and cell phones can contact them. A dealer with a pager doesn\\rquote t have to stay close to a specific telephone, which the police can tap, or a particular location that the police can watch. The readout on the beeper also gives the drug dealer the option of not returning a call placed from an unfamiliar number. A base station can contact multiple pagers, which doesn\u0027t involve phones at all. \\par\r\n\\par\r\nCharlie\u0027s needs are to distribute drugs to his runners and to get paid by them. What if Charlie Lacas protects himself by only communicating with his runners, never with their customers, and uses a paging system, with a different pager for each of his runners, and with pre-defined codes for communication? A runner pages Charlie with an order- a code for a product and another code for a quantity. Charlie replies with a code for a pickup location (one of his houses) and a time. \\par\r\nThis is how a drug deal might go down. The exchange is quick and simple.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nThe question of how Charlie knows about this stuff needs to be dealt with in backstory. I\u0027m supposing Charlie is from a major urban area like New York and started as a runner as a young teen; he\u0027s grown up with this stuff. He\u0027s smart enough to have escaped the big city, and he knows the risks and takes great pains to avoid making mistakes.\\b\\par\r\n\\b0\\par\r\nHow can our guys get past Charlie\u0027s communications?

It provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various story lengths and complexities. This structure can be used for secondary character arcs, thematic explorations, or smaller obstacles that enrich the main plot. To use this beat sheet effectively:\r\nIdentify your subplot or complication and its relationship to the main plot. Outline each beat, considering how it connects to your overall story. Ensure that the subplot or complication enhances rather than detracts from the main narrative. Adjust the scale of each beat based on your story\u0027s needs \uFFFD some may be brief scenes, while others could span multiple chapters. Consider how the resolution of the subplot or complication will impact your main story or character development.",

The second act, the\r\nrising action, has the protagonist seek to solve his problem and\r\nachieve his goal, but he runs into obstacles, or reversals.\r\nThese problems add dramatic tension.
