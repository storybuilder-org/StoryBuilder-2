He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion. I turn back time to the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. This play is memory. Being memory, it is dimly lighted, sentimental, not realistic. In memory everything happens to music, which explains the fiddle in the wings.\u0022 He describes the characters, including the gentleman caller who is an emissary from the world of reality and a symbol of the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for. He also describes the fifth character, the father, who doesn\u0027t appear in the play other than in the picture. This father left them a long time ago.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nAmanda calls Tom to come for the meal. After he appears, she hounds him about his eating habits. He objects and leaves the table to smoke.

Deception?\u0022 She informs Laura that she did not go to the D.A.R. meeting, but to the Rubicam\u0027s Business College to speak to Laura\u0027s teachers about her progress. There she learns that Laura only attended for a few days and has since been deceiving her. When she asks Laura where she has been going during the time she was supposed to be in class, Laura tells of going to various places: the park, the art museum, the Zoo, and the Jewel Box (a glass house where they raise tropical flowers).\\par\r\n\\par\r\nAmanda despairs for their future. She thinks of the possibility of marriage and asks Laura if she has ever liked some boy.  Laura tells her of Jim, a high school boy, who was in \u0022The Pirates of Penzance\u0022 and on the debating team, and who used to call her \u0022Blue Roses\u0022 because he misunderstood what she said when she told him about her attack of pleurosis. He was engaged to Emily, the best dressed girl at Soldan, and must be married now.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nAmanda notes, \u0022Girls that are not cut out for business careers usually wind up married to some nice man. Sister, that\u0027s what you\u0027ll do.\u0022  Laura objects because, \u0022I\u0027m crippled.\u0022  Amanda scolds her for using that word, telling her she only has a slight defect...hardly noticeable.  When people have a slight disadvantage like that, they cultivate other things to make up for it, like charm.  \u0022 One thing your Father had plenty of...was charm.\u0022\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n}\r\n",

It became an obsession. ...the image of the gentleman caller haunted our small apartment. Even when he wasn\u0027t mentioned, his presence hung in Mother\u0027s preoccupied look and in my sister\u0027s frightened, apologetic manner--hung like a sentence passed upon the Wingfields! Mother was a woman of action as well as words. Realizing that extra money would be needed to properly feather the nest and plume the bird, she conducted a vigorous phone campaign, roping in subscribers to a magazine for matrons called, \u0022The Homemaker\u0027s Companion\u0022.\u0022\\par\r\n   Tom and Amanda quarrel. He is frustrated because he has no privacy, not one thing he can call his own. She chastises him for his foul language, for shouting, for bringing Mr. Lawrence\u0027s hideous novel into the house, and for doing things he is ashamed of.  He reminds her who pays the rent on this house, that his patience is at an end also, and that he is working in the warehouse because he has to, not because he wants to.\\par\r\n   \u0022What right have you got to jeopardize your job? Jeopardize the security of us all? How do you think we\u0027d manage?\u0022\\par\r\n   \u0022You think I\u0027m in love with the Continental Shoemakers? I\u0027d rather somebody picked up a crowbar and battered out my brains -- than to go back mornings! How lucky dead people are! For sixty-five dollars a month I give up all that I dream of doing and being ever! If self was all I thought of, I\u0027d be where my Father is...gone.\\par\r\n   When Amanda asks where he is going, he says to an opium den. He tells her he has joined a gang, become a hired assassin, a pimp, a gambler.  He calls her an ugly, babbling old witch.\\par\r\n   In the process of leaving, he strikes the shelf on which Laura\u0027s glass collection is displayed and the glass shatters.  Laura is mentally wounded. Tom is contrite, but can find no words of consolation. Amanda refuses to speak to Tom until he apologizes.\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n}\r\n",

Laura has just been looking for him. He tells her he has been at the movies all night. She innocently asks if he had to stay all night. He tells her that there was also a stage show where he saw a magician with a magic scarf which he gives to Laura. He says the best trick of all was the escape from a nailed-up coffin. He observes that it would come in handy for him...to get him out of \u0022this two-by-four situation.\u0022 It\u0027s easy to get into a nailed-up coffin, but who ever got out?  As he says this, his Father\u0027s picture is spotlighted then the scene dims out.\\par\r\n   At 6:00 a.m. their day begins. Amanda shouting orders, Laura trying to get Tom to make peace, and Tom reluctantly rising. Amanda tells Laura to go to the store for butter and to charge it. Laura goes reluctantly. This gives Tom the opportunity to apologize to Amanda. They make up and she asks him to promise that he will never be a drunkard. He promises. She tells him that Laura was crying over him, that they are both concerned that he will turn out like his Father. She begins the familiar inquisition about where he goes at night. He tells her he goes to the movies for adventure. She insists that most young men find adventure at their work. When he mentions instinct, she tells him that people have gotten away from instinct, that people want superior, intellectual things, that surely his aims are higher than the pigs and monkeys. When he informs her that they are not, she goes back to the subject of Laura.\\par\r\n   Amanda is concerned that Laura is just drifting along. That the only time it is okay to drift along is if it is in her own home with her  husband. She again accuses Tom of only thinking of himself, about the letter he got from the Merchant Marines. She tells him to go...but not until there is someone to take his place - a husband for Laura. She badgers him until he agrees, against his will, to try to find someone at work for Laura. Amanda appears to be the ultimate maternal manipulator.  As the scene fades out, Amanda is back on the phone selling magazine subscriptions.\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n}\r\n",

Amanda asks him to comb his hair, asks him to emulate his Father in this one area...his appearance.  He makes to go outside to smoke. She chastises him for smoking so much. If he quit smoking he could use that money to take an accounting course at college. Unmoved, he states that he would rather smoke...and he steps out on the landing.\\par\r\n   Addressing the audience, Tom tells of the Dance Hall across the alley from their apartment. In the heat of the evening, you could hear the music, see the lights, and watch the couples come out for a breath of air and a bit of necking.  This was the compensation for lives that passed without change or adventure. All over the world, adventure and change were imminent, except here.\\par\r\n   Amanda joins him on the landing. He tells her he has arranged for Laura to have a gentleman caller to dinner.  When he tells her it is to be tomorrow night, she goes into a frenzy. She must make preparations, polish the silver, launder the table linen. Tom tries to downplay the situation. Through many questions, Amanda determines that this Mr. James Delaney O\u0027Conner has a fairly responsible job, is not too good looking or too homely, and has plans for advancement.  He eventually tells her, however,  that the gentleman has no idea that there is an ulterior motive for the dinner...he doesn\u0027t know about Laura. Amanda states that she is sure he will think Laura as lovely a person as they do. Tom warns her that although they don\u0027t even notice that she is crippled anymore, someone new might. He tells her that Laura would appear peculiar to others because she is so shy and introverted.\\par\r\n   As Tom leaves to go to the movies yet again, Amanda\u0027s optimism returns. She calls Laura to leave the dishes and come out and wish on the moon for Happiness and Good Fortune.\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n}\r\n",

Jim had been a hero, always in the spotlight, with tremendous Irish good nature and vitality. He had been expected to go places in the world, but six years later, he was doing only slightly better than Tom. Jim was the only one at the warehouse who was on friendly terms with Tom. He knew that Tom worked on his poems when work was slack.  He called Tom - Shakespeare. Laura had often talked of Jim and his fine voice, but if Jim knew Laura in high school, it was not as Tom\u0027s sister.\\par\r\n   Amanda has transformed the apartment in preparation for the gentleman caller. There is the new light, new curtains, and new sofa pillows.  Laura has been transformed also. She wears a new dress and has a new hairdo, that makes her appear softer and is more becoming. Laura is nervous. Amanda adds padding to Laura\u0027s bosom. Laura notes that it seems they are setting a trap. Amanda states that all girls are a trap, a pretty trap, and men expect them to be. \\par\r\n   Amanda then transforms herself into a revival of her youthful self, wearing the dress in which she had so many triumphs that long ago season. She had suffered from a mild bout of malaria fever all that season, and she had been crazy for jonquils. It had become a joke, Amanda and her jonquils. Malaria fever, jonquils and then this boy.  That was the season Amanda had met Laura and Tom\u0027s father.  Abruptly, her reminiscent mood is shattered. \\par\r\n   When Laura asks the name of their caller that evening and finds out it could be the Jim O\u0027Conner she knew in high school, she becomes very flustered and insists she cannot join them at the table. Amanda insists that she will sit at the table and that she will also answer the door when they arrive. Although Laura affirms that she cannot, Amanda eventually forces her to let them in. After a brief introduction, Laura escapes behind the portieres. Jim tries to talk Tom into taking the public speaking course to better himself at the warehouse. Tom tells him that he has other plans; he has joined the Union of Merchant Seamen instead of paying the light bill. He tells him he is like his father. \u0022The bastard son of a bastard! Did you notice how he\u0027s grinning in his picture in there? And he\u0027s been absent going on sixteen years!\u0022 \\par\r\n  Amanda makes her entrance, shocking both Jim and Tom. Her vivacity and charm win Jim over. She chatters gayly about this and that, telling Jim that Laura was responsible for the dinner. As they go in to sit down at the table, she calls Laura to join them. Laura enters, but is obviously ill. As a storm breaks outside, Tom helps her to the living room sofa, then returns to the table. Amanda asks him to say grace. As he does so, she steals a glance at Jim. In the living room, Laura clenches her hand to her lips and stifles a shuddering sob.\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\r\n\\pard\\tx720\\par\r\n}\r\n",

When they realize that it is not a burnt out fuse, Amanda rightly  deduces that Tom did not pay the light bill. She makes him help with the dishes as punishment.  She sends Jim in with candles and wine to keep Laura company. Being an outgoing sort, he talks her into sipping the wine and sitting on the floor in the candlelight.  She asks him if he has kept up with his singing. It is then that he realizes that they went to school together and that he used to call her Blue Roses. She tells of her clumping into classes. He assures her that her slight handicap was not as noticable as she believes. He tells her that she has low self-esteem and she should think more highly of herself. Everyone has some problems. \\par\r\n   She tells him that she saw all three of his performances in The Pirates of Penzance, but didn\u0027t get his autograph because he was always surrounded by other girls. He signs her program, but assures her that his autograph is not worth much now. Perhaps one day, it will be worth more. Laura asks about his old girlfriend, he speaks disparagingly of her and of how the relationship was all in the girls imagination. He asks her what what she has done since high school. It boils down to her glass collection.\\par\r\n   Jim analyzes Laura\u0027s situation. He tells her that she has an inferiority complex, that she should think of herself as superior in some way. She inquires in what way. He tells her how he thinks about himself and about his aspirations for the future. She is overcome with absolute wonder. He asks if there isn\u0027t one thing she considers of interest more than any other. She tells him of her Glass Menagerie and shows him the oldest, a unicorn. After he puts it down on the table, he crosses to the fire-escape door and since the rain has stopped, opens it to hear the Dance Hall music.\\par\r\n   Jim asks her to dance. As they dance, they bump into the table and the unicorn falls and the horn is broken off. He appologizes, but she shrugs it off.\\par\r\n   He tells her that she is different and different is good. He tells her that she is pretty and that she ought to be kissed. He does so, but is immediately contrite. He realizes what he has done is wrong and he tells her about his steady girl, Betty. He continues to tell her about Betty, not noticing that Laura is bowed by a mental storm.  When he finishes, she gives him the unicorn as a souvenir. At this point, Amanda enters with fruit punch and  macaroons. She chatters away gayly. Jim makes his excuses, telling of his girlfriend, Betty, then leaves.\\par\r\n   Amanda and Laura cannot look at each other. Amanda calls Tom into the room and angerily confronts him. She accuses him of being a selfish dreamer and tells him to leave...to go to the moon. He smashes his glass and stalks to the fire escape.\\par\r\n   While Amanda comforts Laura, Tom addresses the audience again.  \u0022I didn\u0027t go to the moon, I went much further - for time is the longest distance between two places. Not long after that I was fired for writing a poem on the lid of a shoe box. I left Saint Louis. I descended the steps of this fire escape for the last time and followed, from then on, in my father\u0027s footsteps, attempting to find in motion what was lost in space. I traveled around a great deal.\u0022  He tells of cities swept about him like dead leaves, but always being pursued by something - Laura.\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\\par\r\n\r\n\\pard\\tx720\\par\r\n}\r\n",
