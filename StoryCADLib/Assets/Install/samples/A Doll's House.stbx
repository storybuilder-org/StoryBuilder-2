The sudden dissolution of Nora\u0027s marriage was, to 19th century audiences, even more of a shock than to modern audiences.\\par\r\n      Notes on this outline:\\par\r\n      The \\f1 Scene\\f0  outline \\f1 is based on\\f0  \u0027French scenes.\u0027  A scene change is indicated every time a character enters or leaves the stage.\\par\r\n      A number of times in this play,  Ibsen uses a technique which is the stage equivalent of the Sequel. A scene\u0027s protagonist (usually Nora) remains onstage after the scene\u0027s other characters exit, and delivers a brief monolog, reacting to the events in the scene.  In this \\f1 scene\\f0  outline the Sequel tab is often used to describe these transitionary moments.\\par\r\n    The physical appearance of the characters is left vague, as is normal with plays, to allow the \\f1 play-runner \\f0 freedom in casting the roles. \\par\r\n\\par\r\n\r\n\\pard\\fs23\\par\r\n}\r\n",

The doctors told Nora that he must travel to a milder climate if he was to recover. But they had no funds for such a long journey, and Nora felt that Tovald wouldn\u0027t borrow or beg. So she secretly borrowed the money needed for a year in Italy, and told others that it was a gift from her father.",
