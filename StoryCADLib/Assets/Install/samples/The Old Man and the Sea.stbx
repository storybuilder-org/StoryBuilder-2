In late 1951 he began the novella, which was first published in Life magazine and then in book form.  It won the Nobel Prize in 1954.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nThis novella is beautifully plotted. The story problem, that the old man hasn\u0027t caught a fish in a long time, divides into three subplots, Santiago hooking the giant marlin, his battle to catch and kill the fish, and the sharks which take his prize, all told in direct and straightforward order. \\par\r\n\\par\r\nThis problem is framed by the boy Manolin\u0027s coming of age story. The story opens with us learning the boy wanting to go out fishing with Santiago, but having been ordered by his father to go out with other boats, since the old man is unlucky, cursed. The story closes with Manolin seeing the marlin\u0027s carcass and the old man\u0027s damaged hands and weeping, his staying Santiago, and his determination that he will fish with Santiago against his father\u0027s wishes- a coming of age story.\\f1\\fs23\\par\r\n}\r\n",

It provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various story lengths and complexities. This structure can be used for secondary character arcs, thematic explorations, or smaller obstacles that enrich the main plot. To use this beat sheet effectively:\r\nIdentify your subplot or complication and its relationship to the main plot. Outline each beat, considering how it connects to your overall story. Ensure that the subplot or complication enhances rather than detracts from the main narrative. Adjust the scale of each beat based on your story\u0027s needs \uFFFD some may be brief scenes, while others could span multiple chapters. Consider how the resolution of the subplot or complication will impact your main story or character development.",
